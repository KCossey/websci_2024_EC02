What each command did:

1. Returned the number of lines in the test file - in my case, 6 lines. (I hit enter after the last class so I have 5 class lines and one empty line)

2. Added "CS 800" to a new line at the end of the test file; test file now has 7 lines

3. Showed the full text of all the lines in the test file that included the string "CS".

4. Returned the number of lines in the test file that included the string "CS".

5. Sorted the lines in the text file by alphabetical order, then ascending by the first digit of the class number (basically sorted by the full string), then showed the full text of the file. It looks like the blank line was sorted to the top.

6. Sorted the lines in the file by reverse alphabetical order, but still sorted the first digit of the class number as ascending. The blank line is still sorted to the top.

7. Sorted the lines in the file by reverse alphabetical order, but then sorted the class numbers ascending by their full numeric value.

8. Sorted the lines in alphabetical order, then by full numerical value of the classes. It also returned the number of lines that contained (or maybe exactly matched) each string. It shows that there are 2 lines that have CS 800, so this would be a good way to check for duplicates.
